Explanation

Correct answer

The correct answer is option 4: data obtained through a social media platform's API. This is because primary data sources directly provide raw, firsthand data. In the context of studying the effects of social media on mental health, data obtained directly from a social media platform via its API consists of original, unprocessed information such as user interactions, posts, and behavioral data. This type of data is most suitable for an analysis that aims to explore new insights and conduct an original research study, as it has not been filtered or interpreted through secondary analysis like the other options listed.

What you selected

You selected "I don't know yet" or didn't select an option.

Correct answer

Moving averages are primarily used to estimate the trend of time-series data. This means that they help smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term patterns or trends, making it easier to see the underlying direction of the data over time. This is why option 2 is correct. Options 1 and 3 are somewhat related but donâ€™t capture the main purpose of moving averages, which is trend estimation, while option 4 is incorrect because moving averages are not typically used to model seasonal components.

Explanation

Correct answer

The correct answer is Variance, which you selected. Variance is a statistical measure that describes the spread or variability of a data set. It calculates the average of the squared differences from the Mean, providing a clear picture of how much the sales values deviate from their average over the period. This is particularly useful in understanding the consistency or fluctuations in sales of product A from month to month. Other options like Range, Skewness, Kurtosis, and Mean, do not specifically address this aspect of variability in the same comprehensive way that Variance does.

Next Question
Explanation

What you selected

The option you selected, click-through rate (CTR), primarily measures how often people click on the link provided in the campaign relative to the number of times the ad is shown. Although CTR is important for understanding how appealing or effective the ad is at generating clicks, it does not directly measure the level of user interaction or engagement with the content, which is more relevant to brand awareness goals. CTR is more aligned with initial interest rather than deeper engagement metrics.

Correct answer

The correct answer, engagement rate, is the best KPI for measuring the success of a social media campaign aimed at increasing brand awareness. Engagement rate includes metrics such as likes, shares, comments, and other interactions that indicate how actively involved the audience is with the content. This level of interaction is a direct indicator of how much the audience resonates with the message, which is crucial for building brand awareness. By analyzing engagement, the company can better understand how effectively the campaign is capturing and holding the audience's attention.

Explanation

What you selected

Your selection of using a union operation on both datasets is incorrect. A union operation combines all the records from both datasets and removes duplicates. However, it doesn't combine the 'Sales Amount' for the same 'Product ID', which is the requirement in this case. The options of merging datasets using left join on 'Product ID' and 'Category' or performing an inner join on 'Product ID' and 'Category' would also not meet the requirement. A left join includes all records from the left dataset and matching records from the right dataset, while an inner join only includes records that have matching values in both datasets. Neither operation aggregates the 'Sales Amount' for the same 'Product ID'.

Correct answer

The correct option is to apply a full outer join on 'Product ID' with a condition to aggregate 'Sales Amount'. This operation would include all records from both datasets, and for those records with the same 'Product ID', the 'Sales Amounts' from both stores would be combined. When it comes to merging datasets and combining specific column values, a full outer join with an aggregation condition is the most appropriate set operation. Remember, it's crucial to consider the specific requirements of the data manipulation task to choose the right operation.

Next Question
Explanation

Correct answer

The choice of Stratified K-Fold cross-validation is indeed the most appropriate for your scenario involving an imbalanced multi-class dataset. The advantage of Stratified K-Fold is that it ensures each fold of the dataset contains approximately the same percentage of samples of each class as the complete set. This is particularly important in your case because it helps in maintaining a representative mix of the classes, thereby providing a more accurate measure of the model's performance on unseen data. It prevents the model from being biased towards the majority class and improves the reliability of the evaluation, especially in medical diagnosis systems where the balance of sensitivity among classes can be crucial.

Next Question
Explanation

What you selected

The selection you made, "The distribution of age in the dataset changes over time," refers to a change in the population characteristics rather than a fundamental shift in the underlying concept that the model was initially designed to predict. While changing demographics can affect model performance, concept drift specifically relates to changes in the relationships between input features and the target variable, not just changes in the features themselves.

Correct answer

The correct answer, "The definition of bad loans changes," is an example of concept drift because it indicates a shift in the criteria used to define the outcome variable the model is predicting. When the definition of what constitutes a bad loan changes, the historical data the model was trained on no longer represents the same target concept, leading to potential decreases in model accuracy and effectiveness until the model is retrained or adjusted to reflect this new definition.

Question 8 of 11

A data scientist is working on a large-scale machine learning project for a major industry. The data scientist have collected a massive dataset with millions of records to train their model. After performing an initial analysis, the data scientist discovers that the dataset contains a considerable number of potential outliers. The primary objective is to improve the model's accuracy by identifying and eliminating these outliers.

Which of the following methods would be MOST appropriate for achieving this goal?

    discarding all data points that have a high correlation with the target variable to reduce the risk of overfitting the model

    utilizing a fixed threshold to classify data points as outliers based on their standard deviation from the mean value

    employing unsupervised machine learning algorithms like DBSCAN or LOF to cluster the data and identify outlier data points

Question 8 of 11
Back to Domain Score
Previous Question
Next Question
Explanation

What you selected

The approach of using a fixed threshold based on standard deviation from the mean to classify outliers, as mentioned in your selection, can be too rigid for complex datasets. This method assumes that data follows a normal distribution, which might not be the case in many real-world scenarios. It also doesn't account for the possibility that what appears to be outliers could be valid extreme values, significant for the analysis. Hence, this method could lead to incorrect exclusion of important data or failure to detect actual outliers in non-normal distributions.

Correct answer

The correct method involves using unsupervised machine learning algorithms like DBSCAN or LOF to identify outliers. These algorithms are effective because they do not rely on assumptions about the data distribution and can adapt to the data's actual structure. DBSCAN, for example, clusters data points based on density, effectively isolating sparse points as outliers. LOF measures the local deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors, which helps in identifying points that substantially deviate from typical data patterns. This flexibility makes them ideal for handling complex and large datasets with potential outliers.

Explanation

Correct answer

The advertising spend variable is considered a significant predictor of sales revenue because the p-value is 0.05. In hypothesis testing, a p-value of 0.05 or less typically indicates that the null hypothesis can be rejected, suggesting that there is a statistically significant relationship between the predictor (advertising spend) and the outcome (sales revenue). This means that changes in advertising spend are likely to be associated with changes in sales revenue, making it an important variable in the model.

What you selected

You selected "I don't know yet" or didn't select an option.

Correct answer

To find the confidence interval for the mean weight of apples, we use the formula: mean Â± (z-value * (standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))). Here, the mean is 150 grams, the z-value is 1.96, the standard deviation is 10 grams, and the sample size is 81. Plugging in these values gives us 150 Â± (1.96 * (10 / sqrt(81))), which simplifies to 150 Â± (1.96 * 1.11). This calculation results in the interval 150 Â± 2.18, or [147.82, 152.18], which matches option 4. This interval is where we expect the true mean weight of the apples to lie with 95% confidence.

Next Question
Explanation

What you selected

The option to compute the correlation coefficient between weather conditions and injury severity is incorrect because the correlation coefficient is typically used for measuring the strength of a linear relationship between two continuous variables. Here, both weather conditions and injury severity are likely categorical variables (e.g., weather conditions might be labeled as 'rainy', 'sunny', etc., and injury severity as 'low', 'medium', 'high'). The correlation coefficient is not suitable for analyzing relationships between categorical variables.

Correct answer

Creating a contingency table for weather conditions and injury severity is the correct choice because it allows you to examine the frequency distribution of injury severity across different weather conditions. This method is particularly useful for categorical variables, enabling an analysis of how these categories interact or are associated with each other. By observing this table, patterns or trends in injury severity relative to different weather conditions can be identified, which is helpful for understanding their relationship without resorting to graphical methods.
