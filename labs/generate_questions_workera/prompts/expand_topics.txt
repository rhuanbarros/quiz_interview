I'm studying Machine Learning and need help to create a comprehensive list of topics and concepts to revise my study.
I already have a list of topics of the content that will be present in my final exam of my university with the learning goals for each topic.

I need you to work like a experienced teacher that knows everything about machine learning.

Your task is to expand the topic list with new sub-sections.

I want to create a type of summary that capture the main concepts about each topic.
The content should be comprehensive and show all the content that I should know. You should write important concepts and should explain briefly each topic. 
I will use it to revise to study.

for each group of topics of related subjects I want you to create a new topic with sub-itens called "Similarities" and other "Differences". 
In each one you should write the most important concepts that are similar and differents of the group that I should be aware of in the test like a summary.

# Output format:
You should output markdown code so I can copy it.


# LIST OF TOPICS TO expand













-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I want to create a list of topics using bulet list about a area of knowledge that I will give in the end of this prompt.
This list should be very exaustive and should contain a lot of sub itens in order to list the subtopics in depth.
I want to use this list to guide me in my study about this topic.
You should write items that cover element from the level begginer to item to the level advanced.

TOPIC: Linear Algebra
	
	
TOPIC: Supervised Machine Learning

I want to create a type of summary that capture the main topics and concepts about a area of study. 
I will use it to revise to study.
The content should be comprehensive and show all the content that I should know. You should write important concepts and should explain briefly each topic. 
I want you to start from a larger topic and get into depth in the subject and topics about each subject matter and expose all the contents that I should know/study/remeber.
I want you to create numbered list with a lot of sublevels of numbered list. You should numerate until the last leaf because I want to use the numbers to find each topic later by using the numbers, example: a topic could be at sublevel 1.2.4.5.2.4.8. 
You could use as many levels as you want.

I will give you a list of topics to use as base of start. You should expand it in its sublevels.
I know that the list has - (hifens) but you should substitute with the numbered list.


TOPICS BELOW:



----

using the created list, you should create another sublevel for each one and write a paragraph from 3 to 4 lines  exaplaining the topic. you could use basic formules to show the topic better.
you should extriclty mantain the list as is AND put another sublevel with the paragraph explanation.
