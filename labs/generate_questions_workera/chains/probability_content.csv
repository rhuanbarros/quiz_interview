    * **Randomness:** Residuals should be randomly scattered around zero, indicating no systematic pattern.
    * **Constant Variance:** The spread of residuals should be consistent across the range of predicted values.
    * **Linearity:** The relationship between residuals and predicted values should be linear (no curves or patterns).
    * **Outliers:**  Points with unusually large residuals, potentially indicating influential data points.
* **Common Patterns and Their Implications:**
    * **Curved Pattern:** Non-linear relationship between variables, suggesting a need for a different model.

### Key Concepts:

* **Definition:** Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event occurring.
* **Mathematical Formula:**
    * P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

* **Examples:**
    * Flipping a coin twice: The outcome of the first flip does not affect the outcome of the second flip.
    * Drawing two cards from a deck with replacement: Replacing the first card ensures the second draw is independent of the first.
* **Non-Independent Events:**
    * Drawing two cards from a deck without replacement: The probability of drawing a specific card on the second draw depends on what card was drawn first.

### Key Concepts:

* **Poisson Distribution:**
    * Definition: A discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, if these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event.
    * Formula:  P(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k! 
        * Where:
            * P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events
            * λ is the average rate of events in the given interval
            * e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)
            * k! is the factorial of k (k! = k * (k-1) * (k-2) * ... * 2 * 1)
* **Parameters of the Poisson Distribution:**
    * **λ (Lambda):** The average rate of events in the given interval. This is the only parameter of the Poisson distribution.
* **Applications of the Poisson Distribution:**
    * Counting rare events in a fixed interval of time or space, such as:
        * The number of customers arriving at a store in an hour
        * The number of defects in a manufactured product
        * The number of accidents on a highway in a month
* **Calculating Probabilities:**
    * Using the Poisson formula, we can calculate the probability of observing a specific number of events in a given interval.
    * Example: If the average number of customers arriving at a store in an hour is 5, what is the probability of observing 3 customers in the next hour?
        * We can use the Poisson formula with λ = 5 and k = 3 to calculate this probability.
* **Interpreting Probabilities:**
    * The probability of observing a specific number of events is a measure of how likely it is to occur.
    * For example, a probability of 0.1 means that there is a 10% chance of observing that specific number of events.
* **Using Poisson Tables or Software:**
    * Poisson tables or statistical software can be used to calculate probabilities for different values of λ and k.
* **Limitations of the Poisson Distribution:**
    * The Poisson distribution assumes that events occur independently of each other.
    * The average rate of events (λ) must be constant over the given interval.
    * The Poisson distribution is not suitable for modeling events that occur in clusters or have a high probability of occurring close together.

* **Notation:** P(A - B) or P(A \ B)
* **Formula:** P(A - B) = P(A) - P(A ∩ B)
* **Understanding:** This formula states that the probability of A occurring without B is equal to the probability of A minus the probability of both A and B occurring.

### 2. Probability of the Complement of an Event

* **Definition:** The complement of an event A is the set of all outcomes in the sample space that are not in A.
* **Notation:** A' or Aᶜ
* **Formula:** P(A') = 1 - P(A)
* **Understanding:** The probability of the complement of an event is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event itself. 
* **Relationship with Difference:** The complement of an event A can be seen as the difference between the entire sample space and event A.

### 3. Key Concepts and Properties

* **Mutually Exclusive Events:** If events A and B are mutually exclusive, then P(A ∩ B) = 0, and P(A - B) = P(A).
* **Independent Events:** If events A and B are independent, then P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B), and P(A - B) = P(A) * (1 - P(B)).
