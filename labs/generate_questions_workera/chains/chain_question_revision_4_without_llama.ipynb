Here's why:\\\\n\\\\n* **Bernoulli Trial:** Each free throw attempt is a Bernoulli trial with two outcomes: success (making the shot) and failure (missing the shot).\\\\n\\\\n* **Probability of Success:** The probability of success (p) is 60% or 0.6.\\\\n\\\\n* **Variance:** The variance (Var[X]) of a Bernoulli distribution measures the spread of the distribution and is calculated as Var[X] = p(1-p).  \\\\n\\\\nPlugging in the values:\\\\n\\\\nVar[X] = 0.6 * (1 - 0.6) = 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24\\\\n\\\\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\\\\n\\\\n* **a. 0.1:** This is the probability of failure (1-p), not the variance.\\\\n\\\\n* **c. 0.6:** This is the probability of success (p), not the variance.\\\\n\\\\n* **d. 0.36:** This is the square of the probability of success (p^2), not the variance.\", 'answer_a': '0.1', 'answer_b': '0.24', 'answer_c': '0.36', 'answer_d': '0.6'}\n",
